## Personalized Medical Recommendation System
Welcome to our Flask API-based Machine Learning model, designed as a comprehensive Recommendation and Prediction System. Today, I'm excited to present this one-screen dashboard that exemplifies our solution.  

Our system employs a Linear Regression model at its core, focusing on creating an intelligent, user-friendly interface for medical diagnosis and recommendations. Users can input their symptoms into the dashboard, and the system will provide accurate predictions along with relevant recommendations.

## Key Features: 
- ### Comprehensive Recommendations:
  Beyond identifying potential diseases, the system offers a detailed disease description, a list of precautions, suggested workout plans, a tailored medication list, and a diet plan. This holistic approach ensures users not only understand their diagnosis but also receive actionable steps to enhance their health.

- ### Synonym Dictionary:
  A unique feature of our system is the synonym dictionary that maps user-friendly words to medical terms. This allows users to describe their symptoms in their own words while still receiving precise predictions.

- ### Auto-Spelling Correction:
  Integrated spelling correction mechanisms automatically fix any mistakes made during symptom entry, further improving the user experience.

## Overview
The **Personalized Medical Recommendation System** leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide tailored healthcare guidance. By integrating user-provided symptoms and health data, this system predicts potential diseases, recommends personalized medications, and suggests suitable workout routines. Implemented as a Flask API, it ensures accessibility and scalability across various devices.
